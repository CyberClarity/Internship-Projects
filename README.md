## üì° 1. Network Packet Sniffer with Anomaly Detection

### üìå Description
A real-time packet sniffer that logs traffic details and flags potential anomalies (like flooding or port scans).

### ‚öôÔ∏è Technologies Used
- Python
- `scapy`
- `sqlite3`

### üí° Features
- Captures live packets and logs them to SQLite
- Records IPs, protocols, lengths, and timestamps
- Flags any IP with more than 100 packets per run

### ‚ñ∂Ô∏è How to Run
```bash

```

> Replace `wlan0` with your actual network interface (use `ip a` to check).

## üîç 2. Web Application Vulnerability Scanner (CLI)

### üìå Description
A Python-based tool to scan target websites for common vulnerabilities like:
- SQL Injection (SQLi)
- Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)

### ‚öôÔ∏è Technologies Used
- Python

### üí° Features
- Crawls internal links on a target domain
- Submits malicious payloads via forms and URL params
- Detects potential vulnerabilities using basic pattern matching

### ‚ñ∂Ô∏è How to Run
```bash
python3 web_vuln_scanner_cli.py http://testphp.vulnweb.com
```

> Note: The tool defaults to `http://testphp.vulnweb.com` if no URL is passed.
