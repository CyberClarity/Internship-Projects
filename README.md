## 🔍 1. Web Application Vulnerability Scanner (CLI)

### 📌 Description
A Python-based tool to scan target websites for common vulnerabilities like:
- SQL Injection (SQLi)
- Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)

### ⚙️ Technologies Used
- Python
- BeautifulSoup
- `requests`
- `re` module

### 💡 Features
- Crawls internal links on a target domain
- Submits malicious payloads via forms and URL params
- Detects potential vulnerabilities using basic pattern matching

### ▶️ How to Run
```bash
python3 web_vuln_scanner_cli.py http://testphp.vulnweb.com
```

> Note: The tool defaults to `http://testphp.vulnweb.com` if no URL is passed.

## 📡 2. Network Packet Sniffer with Anomaly Detection

### 📌 Description
A real-time packet sniffer that logs traffic details and flags potential anomalies (like flooding or port scans).

### ⚙️ Technologies Used
- Python
- `scapy`
- `sqlite3`

### 💡 Features
- Captures live packets and logs them to SQLite
- Records IPs, protocols, lengths, and timestamps
- Flags any IP with more than 100 packets per run

### ▶️ How to Run
```bash
sudo python3 network_packet_sniffer.py wlan0
```

> Replace `wlan0` with your actual network interface (use `ip a` to check).
